    """ Outputs an expanded tensor to perform rolling window operations on a pytorch tensor.

    Given an input tensor of shape [N, L, C] and a window length W, computes an output tensor of shape [N, L, C, W]
    where the final dimension contains the values from the current timestep to timestep - W + 1.

    Args:
        x (torch.Tensor): Tensor of shape [N, L, C].
        dimension (int): Dimension to open.
        window_size (int): Length of the rolling window.
        step_size (int): Window step, defaults to 1.
        return_same_size (bool): Set True to return a tensor of the same size as the input tensor with nan values filled
                                 where insufficient prior window lengths existed. Otherwise returns a reduced size
                                 tensor from the paths that had sufficient data.

    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Tensor of shape [N, L, C, W] where the window values are opened into the fourth W dimension.
